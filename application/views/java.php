<p style="text-align: justify;"><b style="text-transform: uppercase;">1. Introduction:</b>  <br>One characteristic that is contant in software industry today is <b>Change</b>. Change is one of the most critical aspects of software development and management. New tools and new approaches are announced almost everyday. <br><b>Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)</b> is an approach to program organization and development, which attempts to eliminate some of the pitfalls of the conventional programming methods by incorporating the best of structured programming features with several new concepts.<br><b>Java</b>, is pure object oriented programming language.</p>

 <p style="text-align: justify;"><b style="text-transform: uppercase;">1. Object Oriented Paradigm:</b>  <br>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based upon objects (having both data and methods) that aims to incorporate the advantages of modularity and reusability. Objects, which are usually instances of classes, are used to interact with one another to design applications and computer programs.<br><i>Objectâ€“Oriented Programming as a method of implementation in which programs are organized as cooperative collections of objects, each of which represents an instance of some class, and whose classes are all members of a hierarchy of classes united via inheritance relationships</i>

 	<br>
 	<b>Features of Object Oriented Paradigm:</b>

 	<br>1.         Programs are divided into what are known as Objects.
<br> 2.        Methods that operate on the data of an object are tied together in the data structure.
<br> 3.        Data is hidden and cannot be accessed by the external functions
<br>  4.       Object may communicate with each other through methods.
